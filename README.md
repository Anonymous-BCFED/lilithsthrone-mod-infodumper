# AnonymousBCFED_InfoDumper
InfoDumper is a very, very simple plugin for just dumping some game data from Lilith's Throne into JSON files that a save editor can use.  It's mostly a practical example on how to merge dependencies.

While there is a `res/` directory, all the fun stuff is in the src/ folder.

## What it does

This mod will poop out some JSON files into `data/internalData/` after the `onInitUniqueNPCs()` signal is called.

InfoDumper will also add some additional lines to console corresponding to certain signal calls.


## Directory Structure

The output directory structure looks like this:

<!-- Generated by tree command on Linux -->
```
.
├── LilithsThrone_#_#_#_#.jar
└── res
    └── mods
        └── $AUTHORNAME
            └── plugins
                └── infodumper.jar
```

I also recommend adding a `README` to the root of the mod explaining what it is and how to install it.
